The app will display list of clickable "students." When a student answers a question, that students name will disapear. Only students who don't answer will remain. If you're the last student, you will be assigned to have to endure an hour one on one session with Marcus.

This app will help encourage students that are shy or less confident to answer questions that are posed to the class so that they wouldn't have to have Marcus try to help them learn concepts for an entire hour. 

We could try to convince the students that it wasn't that terrible to have to hang out with Marcus for an hour. I also think we could even convince them that it's for their own good because they will have to learn patience when they eventually have an unbearable coworker themselves.
